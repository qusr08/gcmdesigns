            Hi! I'm Gabriela (Gaby) Colon-Melendez and I am currently studying at Virginia Tech as a third-year Industrial Design major. I am originally from Northern New Jersey but I love spending my semesters in Blacksburg and being surrounded by fellow Hokies!
        </p>
        <h2>Growing Up...</h2>
        <p>
            In an effort to continue my curiosity and passion for art and building, many of my summers growing up were spent in STEM/Engineering/Enrichment camps which allowed me to grow and further discover the world of design and creating. From rapid prototyping
            and mechanical drawings to coding and science experiments, I was hooked!
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been passionate about design, art, and innovation for as long as I can remember but I began fostering that appreciation much more seriously in high school while on my school's robotics team as a mechanical subteam member my 1st year and a design/CAD
            subteam member the remaining 3. I mainly learned and worked with SolidWorks throughout my robotics/high school career but I was also introduced to Fusion 360 and AutoCAD as well. I was first introduced and gained experience with our metal
            shop and woodshop (for prototyping and building of the robot/mechanisms) during my time on the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was able to take a few engineering courses in high school that in combination with my experience in robotics solidified my need to continue creating and making which leads me to where I am today.
        </p>
        <h2>Where I Am Now...</h2>
        <p>
            I have already grown so much being a part of VTID and I am very eager to continue learning more about sustainable and ergonomic design as well as expanding my 3D modeling/rendering knowledge to have more variety in my software catalog. I am extremely
            grateful to have the opportunity to study in such a successful and challenging program.
