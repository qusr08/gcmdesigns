        text*1*#F2F2F2*start*start*a modern utensil set*h1*This flatware set was a result of a final project for a Computer Aided Industrial Design course. We were instructed to model a set of flatware with visually and form related utensils.*p*I decided to make a modern set with wooden inlays in the 3 main utensils, the knife, fork, and spoon. As for the additional utensils, I decided on a wooden spoon with teeth, as well as wooden tongs. The wooden accents on the metal utensils brought the whole set together. This project was a great way to practice and showcase what I've learned throughout the course.*p|
