        text*1*#EAE5E1*start*start*an essentials bag*h1*The Go-toGo bag is your go-to bag for when you've got to go! This essentials bag has you covered, with a 3-card slot wallet flap, inside pocket, 2 loops for hanging, and a detachable wristlet. There's no longer a need to dig through your backpack, tote bag, or purse when you have the Go-toGo because the loops and clips give you the ability to clip it onto other straps and loops of your main bag in two orientations. If you like carrying it on its own, the detachable wrist strap will be of perfect use! And as an added level of security, the wallet flap can also be flipped over onto itself to hide your cards.*p*This was our second soft goods project of 3rd year IDS and I was extremely happy with my successful prototype. I learned how to sew for this project and I was able to use flat patterns to help with the design.*p|

        text*1*white*center*start*I did quite a few rounds of prototyping ranging from paper prototypes for size purposes and for the wallet's flat pattern to a few fabric prototypes as well to understand its form. After some adjustments to my design after creating the sewn fabric prototype, I was able to develop my final flat pattern and design that resulted in my final prototype.*p|
