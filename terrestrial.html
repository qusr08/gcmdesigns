        text*1*white*center*start*A diy succulent orb kit*h1*Terrestrial is a succulent planting kit made to be displayed in windows! The kit comes with all materials needed and instructions for users to create their own mini terrestrial orbs at home. After assembly, the orbs' heights can be adjusted vertically as well as rotated every few days in order for the orb to receive even amounts of sunlight The succulents and metal islands can be customized to the user's preference when creating and decorating their orbs. The assembly of the orbs and the frame can then be installed into any window due to its expandable tension rod that can be adjusted to fit the users window sill.*p|

        text*1*white*center*start*what's included?*h1*The kit comes with premade moss balls. The making of these moss balls include forming soil around a tube and then planting moss on the outside layer of the soil ball. The internal tube allows for the moss ball to glide up and down the telescoping pole in order to re-adjust the height of the orb and to rotate it.*p|

        text*1*white*center*start*creating your orb*h1*1. Poke holes into the moss balls with the aerator.*p*2. Place succulents into the holes and secure them by pushing the greening pins into the plant and into the moss ball.*p*3. Attach the metal island plates onto the orb to your liking. The metal plates are labeled with different sizes with the corresponding orb that matches in size.*p|

        text*1*white*center*start*6. Slide the moss ball onto the telescoping pole and screw in the end piece to secure it.*p*7. If wanted, adjust the height of the orb by pushing the button lock on the telescoping pole and either pushing up or pulling down until the button locks into the next hole.*p|

        text*2*#A0B273*center*center*prototyping process*h2|
        text*1*white*center*start*When creating Terrestrial, I was inspired by planets and spherical greenery. I knew I wanted to create something with more organic shapes and to the left here is a mood board representing some of the inspiration I looked at before diving into the design.*p|

        image*1*projects/terrestrial/prototypeplant1.png|
        text*1*white*center*start*In order for me to understand the form and assembly of Terrestrial, I decided to physically prototype the orbs into a semi works-like and looks-like model. I made holes in the moss orbs and placed a tube inside to see if it would be possible to rotate the orbs and move them up and down on the vertical rod (which they did!).*p|
        text*1*white*center*start*I decorated and “planted” multiple sizes of spheres to understand the form of the orbs hanging on the frame.*p|

        image*1*projects/terrestrial/prototypeplant4.png|
        text*1*white*center*start*I also decided to prototype some of the metal plates that would be added on with spikes. The spikes needed to be thin and sharp enough to be able to pierce through the moss ball and stay attached even if rotated.*p|
