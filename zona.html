        text*1*white*start*start*a standalone chair*h1*Zona is a comfortable, cushioned, and spacious stand-alone chair perfect for anything ranging from working from home to relaxing or sleeping! With Zona, the user can assure themselves they've selected a multifunctional piece of furniture that fits in any home because of its modern and cozy design. The deep-set seat allows for comfort for those ranging from 5'2'' to 6'0''.*p*Zona was made in collaboration with Azaria Molina and Luke Benish for a 2nd year IDS studio project and was sponsored by Txtur, a furniture company based in Roanoke, VA who provided many materials/fabrics and insight on the process of creating furniture.*p*This was my first time experimenting with and ultimately creating furniture! The upholstery process was interesting to figure out, and getting to create something from stage 1 until the end was incredibly rewarding. I'm very proud of our final product!*p|
