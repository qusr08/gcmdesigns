            <p>Winsom is a charming and simple stool created for the annual 2023 Virginia Tech Industrial Design Program Competition. The prompt this year was to create a "studio stool" in a week and a half that could be implemented into studios and workspaces around our program buildings. My groupmates were also Industrial Design students, Becca Rainey and Ethan Carroll. Winsom was awarded Honorable Mention.</p>
            <p>Winsom is a sturdy, stackable, and portable stool that is perfect for our studio workspaces. The name Winsom comes from the descriptor "winsome" which means attractive or appealing in appearance or character. It perfectly encapsulates our stool because of its appealing geometric designs combining the circular seat and triangular pointed legs.</p>

            <p>We created two heights of Winsom stools to accommodate for the two heights of studio desks that we have throughout the design and architecture buildings. The legs attach to one another by using biscuit connections and the seat is attached using 2-inch angle brackets. The legs slightly point outward in order to have a comfortable and secure feel when sitting in the stool. We also prioritized the ability to stack and move the stool easily because of how often stools and chairs are being stored and moved throughout our spaces.</p>
