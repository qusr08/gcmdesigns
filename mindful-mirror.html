        text*1*white*start*start*organized. central. simple.*h1*The Mindful Mirror is the mirror that doesn't let you forget the big things so you can keep enjoying the little things. This is a centralized entryway unit that includes two shelves, five hooks, and a mirrored, digital touchscreen display of a calendar, to-do list, daily/weekly weather, and reminders and notifications. The Mindful Mirror is an excellent addition to any household, whether that be of an independent, family, or someone who may need additional assistance throughout the day.*p|

        text*1*#BCCCD6*start*start*collaborators*h1*The Mindful Mirror was made in collaboration with my group mates, Farida Hanna and Jordan Jones, as well as our collaborator and programmer Frank Alfano. We also received guidance from our professors Ben Kirkland and Martha Sullivan and mentor Carolyn Weaver from SFCS Inc. who also sponsored our groups financially to help create our final prototypes. The Aging in Place project for the third-year IDS studio with the Warm Hearth Village and SFCS Arch has been an annual collaboration for 13 years.*p|

        text*1*#BCCCD6*start*start*the mindful app*h1*The Mindful Mirror has an accompanying app for mobile devices that the owner of the mirror can use to add events or tasks to their mirror from anywhere. The app is also great for other relatives, family members, or caregivers that are granted access to edit and add events to someone's Mindful Mirror.*p*The idea behind the Mindful Mirror came from multiple sit-downs with the Warm Hearth Village, a senior living community. After talking with the residents, my group found common themes of forgetfulness, memory loss, and the struggle to stay organized. From our research, we found that 5.4 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's and that 40% of US adults age 65+ have memory impairment associated with age. We also found that 1 in 9 adults ages 45+ report confusion or some degree of memory loss (CDC Subjective Cognitive Decline Among Adults Aged 45+ Years in the United States). The National Institute of Aging announced some great tips for dealing with forgetfulness that included, following a daily routine, planning tasks, making to-do lists, using memory tools like calendars, and putting essentials like wallets, glasses, and keys, in the same spot every day. We took these into strong consideration, and created the Mindful Mirror, which tackles each of those!*p|
        text*1*white*start*start*final prototype*h1*Ideally, the manufactured product would have a custom computer with the Mindful Mirror program coded into itself, add the display would be its reflective touchscreen monitor. We created a physical semi-works-like, looks-like prototype from ⅝” plywood, 5 hooks, a monitor, a reflective two-way acrylic mirror, a raspberry pi, and an infrared touchscreen frame.*p|
