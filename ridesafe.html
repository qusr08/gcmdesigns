            <h1 class="project-header">innovating rideshare.</h1>
            <p>The RideSafe system is a product of a collaboration between Virginia Tech Industrial Design and General Motors. In spring of 2023 VTID collaborated with General Motors to cultivate accessible innovation in the auto industry. Our team researched the lack of accessibility, safety, and adaptive measures in rideshare services. RideSafe is a threefold timeline proposal of innovative suggestions that highlight the future of safety and accessibility in rideshare for the General Motors company.</p>

            <p>Each stage of the RideSafe program has three highlighted features: one that focuses on unlocking/entering the vehicle, one for a passenger display with safety features, and finally an innovated driver display that aids and improves their experience as well. In rideshare services, there are concerns for safety for both the driver and passenger. In these key features we aim to adapt and innovate the most common areas that are lacking in accessibility and safety.</p>

            <p>The Now focuses on the ability to integrate key accessibility features into new General Motors vehicles. With an anticipated two to three years until the technology is ready for the market, After discussing with General Motors they informed us it would be quicker for new features to be implemented into new GM vehicles. The Now ensures that rideshare drivers and standard customers alike can have non-obtrusive safety and accessibility capabilities that improve the passenger experience.</p>

            <p>The Next is expected to be implemented in a three to five year timeframe, this section focuses on the ability to add accessibility capabilities to existing cars with the goal of improving the rideshare experience for disabled individuals. With features such as RFID vehicle identification, interactive passenger displays, and opportunities for seamless passenger pickup experiences, The Now improves upon existing rideshare services.</p>

            <p>The Future is intended to be implemented with the General Motors subsidiary, Cruise, an upcoming autonomous rideshare vehicle. Taking the integrated features of The Now one step further, The Future looks approximately seven years ahead and aims to ensure that accessibility considerations are carried through to the next stage of General Motors vehicles while continuing to advance technologically.</p>
