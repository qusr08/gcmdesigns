            <p>Hi! My name is Gaby and I am a fourth-year Industrial Design student at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the College of Architecture, Arts, and Design. This page displays the work and projects I have created or been a part of.</p>

                <h3>growing up...</h3>
                <p>In an effort to continue my curiosity and passion for art and building, many of my summers growing up were spent in STEM/Engineering/Enrichment camps which allowed me to grow and further discover the world of design and creating. From rapid prototyping and mechanical drawings to coding and science experiments, I was hooked!</p>
                <p>I have been passionate about design, art, and innovation for as long as I can remember but I began fostering that appreciation much more seriously in high school while on my school's robotics team as a mechanical subteam member my 1st year and a design/CAD subteam member the remaining 3. I mainly learned and worked with SolidWorks throughout my robotics/high school career but I was also introduced to Fusion 360 and AutoCAD as well. I was first introduced and gained experience with our metal shop and woodshop (for prototyping and building of the robot/mechanisms) during my time on the team.</p>
                <p>I was able to take a few engineering courses in high school that in combination with my experience in robotics solidified my need to continue creating and making which leads me to where I am today.</p>
                <h3>where am i now...</h3>
                <p>I have already grown so much being a part of VTID and I am very eager to continue learning more about sustainable and ergonomic design as well as expanding my 3D modeling/rendering knowledge to have more variety in my software catalog. I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity to study in such a successful and challenging program.</p>
