        text*1*white*start*start*a hygiene/first aid kit*h1*The MioMed Kit is a durable, portable, and water-resistant personal hygiene/first aid kit. The MioMed Kit has one large compartment, three medium-sized compartments, a side pocket perfectly sized for a Narcan, 5 mesh pockets varying in size on the back, and a couple of loops for thinner objects. The bag has a nylon adjustable strap with a rubber handle for easy carrying.*p*It also has two clips in the back that attach to its connecting clips that are inside of the backpack. The front of the kit has a mesh pocket and two clear pockets perfect for the resource card provided to the recipient from C2C as well as an informational packet. That packet is an illustrated General First Aid treatment booklet that has information on how to treat the most common injuries. There is also ample room inside of the bag for the revive kit and sharps containers that are often provided or offered.*p|

        text*1*white*center*start*For this project, the 3rd year VTID studio class worked with C2C (Connection to Care) and Dynovis to ideate and create first aid kits to implement into care bags that were created for those in need. This was a very rapid prototyping process! This was my first experience working with soft goods and I learned so much. I created this bag with the idea that the pieces would be welded together as explained to us was possible by Dynovois, the manufacturer. I learned that a flat pattern is necessary even if there will be little sewing. I only had loose sketches and measurements when creating the MioMed Kit so after learning this, for our next soft goods project, I was sure to include and use flat patterns to assist in my design process.*p|
