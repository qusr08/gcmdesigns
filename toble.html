        text*1*white*start*start*a doble tostonera*h1*Toble is a double (doble) Tostonera, an enhancement of the Tostonera, a traditional Puerto Rican wooden tool used to create tostones (plantain slices that are fried twice). Tostonera's are normally two blocks of wood that flatten together through the use of hinges. Usually, one block of wood has a hemisphere, and the other has a curved out section to allow for the hemisphere to sit and shape the tostones. There are other designs for tostoneras that produce flat tostones. I decided to combine both ideas into one to have an option for curved/cupped tostones, and when flipped there's a side to produce flatter-shaped tostones.*p*This was a project for my 2nd year IDS studio class and although this product does not stir, scrape, or scoop, (I asked for permission!) it does successfully redesign a unique kitchen tool that is close to my heart and culture.*p|
